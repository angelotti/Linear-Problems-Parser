This project consists of a parser which transforms a linear problem from this form
(LP 1)
max 540x1+ 205x2+ 175x3+90x4
s.t. 15x1+ 4x2+ 5x3+ 3x4> 50000
12x1+ 6x2+ 3x3+ 3x4< 40000
150x1+ 60x2+ 50x3+ 40x4> 300000
x1> 150, x2 > 270, x3 > 310, x4 > 450

to 

(LP 2)
c = [ 540,  205,  175, 90]
A = [[ 15,  4,  5,  3], [12,  6,  3,  3], [150,  60,  50,  40]]
b = [50000, 40000, 300000]
Eqin = [1, -1, 1]

in order to another program to read and solve the problem using a Simplex Algorithm


The usage of the parser is simple.
1)Create a problem.txt file  inside the project folder 
2)Import project into Eclipse
3)Run
4)A problem(LP-2).txt file will be created with the transformed problem
